# Slideshower

View images and videos of a local folder (or its subfolders) in random order.

## Create separate collections
Each collection is a set of folders - a collection can be based on any theme, like reference images or travel photos.

A collection can consist of any number of folders

## View the images and videos of your collections in randomized order
Every time you click "Next" a random image or video from the collection is chosen.

The "Back" button allows you to go back through the previously shown media to get an extra look.

## Formats like video and gif are supported as well

## Note media you want to delete

Found an image you no longer want around? Click "Note" and continue viewing your collection.

When you click "Return", a dialog reminds you of the media you noted and allows you to delete them directly, or clicking the thumbnail to show the file in its folder - maybe you just wanted to move the image or edit it.

## To do
- Automatically show the next media after a set interval
- Functionality to edit and create new collections within Slideshower
- Gracefully handle if a collection without any media is shown
